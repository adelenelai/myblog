### On the future of Chemicals and Waste

In Bonn, scientists, policy-makers, NGOs, industry stakeholders are gearing up for a week of intense discussions on the topic of international management of chemicals and waste. 

ICCM5 is the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), organised by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). It falls under the SAICM framework, a policy framework and voluntary mechanism under UNEP that stands for the *Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management*.

After years of Intersessional Meeetings, in which amongst other things, SAICM's post-2020 future was deliberated at length, I'm personally hopeful for the outcomes of ICCM5. 

(SAICM was established in 2002 with the original aim to achieve the sound management of chemicals and waste throughout their life-cycle by 2020. It's now 2023 and well...we still have weekly news of environmental contamination, chemicals in humans, and taglines like "Forget Diamonds, PFAS are Forever". Clearly, more work needs to be done, but hopefully the origins of the hashtag #Beyond2020 are clear.)

In particular, I'm especially looking forward to the discussions in the Side Event on the Science Policy Panel (SPP), as I see it as a culmination of the determined (dogged?) efforts of the Open Ended Working Group, a subsidiary body of the Conference, to establish a SPP.
