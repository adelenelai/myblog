### Thoughts on the upcoming International Conference on Chemicals Management 2023 (ICCM5)

After consulting the expertise of Weird Barbie, Margot Robbie's troubled Barbie reaches a pivotal turning point:

*...maintain her regular life in blissful ignorance, symbolised by a princess pink high-heel, or opt for the Birkenstock, representing going to the Real World to find out "the truth about the universe"?*

I think we could all use a Weird Barbie at some point in our lives; she makes us interrogate our life choices (or at the very least, the choices we make professionally).

For me, "professional choices" translate to "what questions do I want to answer in my work?", and as I think about the forthcoming ICCM5, I wanted to reflect on my experience attending ICCM4, 8 years ago, what it meant to me, and what I think about the discussions to take place in Bonn next week.
