Hello World :)

I work at the intersection of cheminformatics and environmental chemistry, which is what this blog will mostly be about.

I completed my [MSc. Environmental Sciences](https://ibp.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where I was awarded the [ETH Master's Scholarship](https://ethz.ch/students/en/studies/financial/scholarships/excellencescholarship.html).

Prior to that, I graduated *magna cum laude* with a  [B.A. Chemistry](https://www.wellesley.edu/chemistry) from Wellesley College, USA, where I received the Gulick Farnsworth scholarship award.

Currently, I am doing a joint/dual PhD *(finishing in 2022!)* at the [Environmental Cheminformatics](https://wwwen.uni.lu/lcsb/research/environmental_cheminformatics/research_projects) Group based at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, Luxembourg and the [Cheminformatics and Computational Metabolomics](https://cheminf.uni-jena.de/) Group, based at Friedrich Schiller University, Germany.

In my PhD, I develop open cheminformatics and computational methods to identify unknown chemicals detected in the environment. I’ve worked with [Swiss](https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-021-00475-1) and [Luxembourgish](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenvironau.1c00008) authorities to help identify chemical pollutants detected using Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry. Working with *open environmental chemistry data* is critical to our efforts.

My current interests are in tackling the most challenging **next frontier of environmental unknowns – substances of Unknown or Variable composition, Complex reaction products, or Biological materials ([UVCBs](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c00321))**.

UVCBs include compounds forming homologous series such as surfactants and PFAS mixtures. I am developing cheminformatics methods to help identify UVCBs in environmental samples.

Besides my studies and PhD research, I have contributed technical expertise to multiple international projects related to **sustainability, chemicals, and waste**, most recently to UN Environment’s [Global Chemicals Outlook II report](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/global-chemicals-outlook-ii-legacies-innovative-solutions) and [Assessment Report on Issues of Concern: Chemicals and Waste Issues Posing Risks to Human Health and the Environment](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/33807/ARIC.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). I also led a [report on Solid Waste Management in Small Island Developing States](https://tdlab.usys.ethz.ch/teaching/tdcs/former/cs2016.html), following fieldwork in the Seychelles.

I was born and grew up in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.
